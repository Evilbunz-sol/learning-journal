                <p class="banner-content-message">  I like to think of myself as a lifelong learner. I used to spend hours and hours learning, then try to create simple projects using what I learned or work new techniques into existing projects. <br> <br> While that was fun, I felt like it would be helpful to share what I was learning and most things about my journey with the world. </p>

                <h2 class="banner-content-title"> How I got started </h2>
                <p class="banner-content-message"> I started simple and gradually grew my learning journal site. I would take notes about what I was learning. After each learning session, I'd use my notes to not only reflect on what I learned but also write short summaries of what I learned using my own words. <br> <br> That helped me grok what I was learning, and I realized that posting my learning summaries was also helping others learn and stay motivated. </p>
